Notes
=======================

o) The assignment asked us to overload the '<', '>' and '-' operators for the
   date class.   We added the declarations to the date.h header file:

      bool operator>(const Date &d);
      bool operator<(const Date &d);
      int operator-(const Date &d);

   And the code to date.cpp:

      bool Date::operator>(const Date &d)
      {
         return(dayOfYear > d.dayOfYear);
      }

      bool Date::operator<(const Date &d)
      {
         return(dayOfYear < d.dayOfYear);
      }

      int Date::operator-(const Date &d)
      {
         return(dayOfYear - d.dayOfYear);
      }

   As you can see, because each Date object has a 'dayOfYear' field, it is easy
   to tell if one Date is larger (or smaller) than another.   We can also subtract
   one Date object's 'dayOfYear' field from the other Date object's 'dayOfYear'
   field to implement: operator- (which lets us subtract two Dates).

o) We use our overloaded Date 'operator>' in 'ValidateInput' (AlaskanCruise.cpp),
   here's the relevant code:

      else
      {
         if(dep > book)
         {
            bValidInput = true;
         }
         else
         {
            out << 
               "departure date (" << dep.GetFormattedDate() << ") must be later than booking date (" <<
                  book.GetFormattedDate() << ")";
         }
      }

   The line that says:

         if(dep > book)

   Is there the 'operator>' function is used, we could not compare two date objects this
   way (using '>') if we did not implement 'operator>' for our Date calss.

o) Our overload of 'operator-' is used in 'CalculateFare' (also, AlaskanCruise.cpp).   Here's
   the relevant code:

      if((dep - book) < DAYS_TO_DEPART_REQD)
         fare =  (1.0 - DISCOUNT_PERCENT / 100.0) * fare;

   See how we are subtacting the booking date from the departure date?  We can only subtract
   two Date objects because we implemented 'operator-' for our Date class.

o) Lastly, we were asked to implement 'operator +=' in our AlaskanCruise class to allow the user
   to specify the number of excursions.   Here's the declaration from AlaskanCruise.h

      const AlaskanCruise & operator +=(int exNumber);

   And here is the code from AlaskanCruise.cpp:

      const AlaskanCruise &AlaskanCruise::operator +=(int exNumber)
      {
         numberOfExcursions += exNumber;
         return(*this);
      }

o) The 'operator +=' we supplied for our AlaskanCruise class is used in 'p8.cpp' in the
   'makeReservation' function.  Here's the relevant code:

      AlaskanCruise cruise(
         name,
         nPeople,
         nDays,
         booking,
         departure
      );

      cruise += nExcursions;

   Notice how we no longer pass the number of excurions to AlaskanCruise's constructor (as
   we did previously in assignment p6).  The number of excurions is now supplied using
   our overloaded AlaskanCruise 'operator+='.

o) Finally, note that when we calculate the fare, we do it thusly:

      void AlaskanCruise::CalculateFare()
      {
         // Calculate the total fare

         fare = 0.0;

         if(numberDaysCruise == 7)
            fare += numberOfPass * FARE_SEVEN;

         else
            fare += numberOfPass * FARE_NINE;

         if((dep - book) < DAYS_TO_DEPART_REQD)
            fare =  (1.0 - DISCOUNT_PERCENT / 100.0) * fare;

         fare += 325.0 * numberOfExcursions;
      }

   As you can see, we apply the number of excursions *after* we've
   calculated the base fare.  This is what I believe the spec wanted, however,
   if we were supposed to apply the discount to everything we just need to 
   move the line the adds in the excursion cost above the line that applies
   the discount, like this:

      void AlaskanCruise::CalculateFare()
      {
         // Calculate the total fare

         fare = 0.0;

         if(numberDaysCruise == 7)
            fare += numberOfPass * FARE_SEVEN;

         else
            fare += numberOfPass * FARE_NINE;

         if((dep - book) < DAYS_TO_DEPART_REQD)

         fare += 325.0 * numberOfExcursions;
            fare =  (1.0 - DISCOUNT_PERCENT / 100.0) * fare;
      }
// use initializer
AlaskanCruise::AlaskanCruise(string resName, int numPass, int numDays, int numEx, Date booking, Date departure): 
    reservation(resName), numberOfPass(numPass), numberDaysCruise(numDays), numberOfExcursions(numEx),
    book(booking), dep(departure)

{
    ValidateDate();
}
